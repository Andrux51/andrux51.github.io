			Little Elk Meadows Lodge is a Lyons, Colorado bed &amp; breakfast lodging nestled along the edge of scenic Rocky Mountain National Park.
			We're <a href="contact.html">located</a> about an hour from downtown Denver, and only minutes from Estes Park.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are family and pet friendly, so don't be afraid bring them along!
			When it's time to get some exercise, your pets will love our fenced yard areas.
			We offer pet sitting for you while you enjoy a trip into town for shopping and dining at many locally owned establishments.
		</p>
		<p>
			We offer several fun <a href="packages.html">packages</a> for our guests, or you can immerse yourself
			in the surrounding area to find a number of activities including hiking, horseback riding, birdwatching, fishing, and more.
			We would be happy to help you plan your vacation while you stay with us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Breakfast is made fresh daily in our fully-equipped kitchen and served when you're ready in the morning.
			We enjoy cooking and like to provide a different main dish each day served with fresh fruit, coffee, tea, milk, and juice.
			We can accommodate special diets, so please inform us of your dietary needs when you book your room.
			If you prefer to cook your own meals, we're happy to step aside and let you show off your culinary skills.
		</p>
		<p>
			Behind the house, we have a sitting area with a fire pit that we can light at your request, and we can even provide ingredients for making s'mores.
			Feel free to share stories or have a sing-along around the fire!
		</p>

			If you're curious about something that we haven't covered here, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> right away so we can answer all your questions!

		<p><h1 align=center>Our History</h1></p>
		<p>
			We're Mary and Randy Caner, longtime residents of the area. 
			Our lovely home was built in 1996. In the 1970s this area was known as Little Elk Meadows before being renamed to Pinewood Springs,
			and we decided that we wanted to name our lodge in a way that honored the local history. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We officially opened for business in August 2010, and have really enjoyed getting the chance to share our home with many wonderful guests.
			We pride ourselves in taking great care of our guests, making them feel at home from the moment they arrive.
			We look forward to making our mark on the local history for years to come.
