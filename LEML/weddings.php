			Our Bed &amp; Breakfast isn't just a great place for lodging, but also a beautiful venue for your wedding, offering a private setting in the mountains. 
			We have a lovely wedding gazebo in our outdoor ceremony area, and the way that the land rolls creates an ampitheatre-like effect. 
			Because of the slope, we do not recommend using chairs for your ceremony, but we have handsewn burlap-covered sawdust bales which are quite comfortable and provide sturdy, solid seating. 
			Rental of the Bed &amp; Breakfast for the night of your wedding is included in some packages; this includes the Honeymoon Suite and all additional bedrooms (four) and bathrooms (two), as well as a loft area with a sleeper sofa.
			You'll love how close we are to both Lyons and Estes Park when you're looking for services for your wedding day!
